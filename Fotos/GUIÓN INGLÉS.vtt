Hello, I’m Joan Briz Chornet, and together with
my colleague Jesús Patiño Casas, we’re going to

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:17.360
present our website. Here, we can see the
homepage. Next to the title of our

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:28.360
page, we have a search bar with five options.
The first is 'Home,' which redirects us to

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.400
this same homepage we're viewing.
The second is the 'Index,' which, as we can see,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:44.280
has an index of the same page. The third is
'Contact,' where we can find a form

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:55.120
to get in touch with us, with our contact hours
listed below. Fourth, we have the encyclopedia

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.880
article search, where we can look up
articles from the website's own encyclopedia,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:15.040
and finally, we have a feedback form
for the website itself.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.080
On the other hand, we have our alphabetical index,
where we can select tabs like

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.920
the letter A, which shows different conditions,
along with a brief description,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:40.640
a table, an image, and sometimes a video. If
we return to the homepage, in the body section,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.320
we can also see some articles, some of which
link to other sections of the website, while

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.080
others direct to external websites. Additionally,
we can see an image map that links

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:07.560
to external pages about the most
common diseases in each continent. We have an

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.680
accessibility button where we can view the
WCAG criteria that our website meets. In terms of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.880
usability and accessibility, our website offers
different page styles, including dark mode,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:38.240
high contrast mode, large text mode,
and a mode with both large text and high contrast.
